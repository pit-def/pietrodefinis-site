          <h2 class="section-title">The Catalyst approach</h2>
          <p>
            In chemistry, a catalyst doesn‚Äôt change the elements of a reaction. 
            It helps them connect, align, and reach products faster. <br>
            That‚Äôs what I do with people, ideas, and projects.
          </p>
          <p> 
            I‚Äôm not a scientist, a communicator, or a project manager. <br>
            I‚Äôm the intersection between them. <br>
            The point where science and innovation meets storytelling, where ideas turn into action and where teams start moving with purpose. <br>
            As a Project Catalyst, I help organizations, researchers, start-up and creators accelerate their impact by reducing the friction between disciplines and people.
          </p>

          <p>
            I use the same principles that drive a good chemical reaction: understanding the mechanism, removing barriers, and helping the system flow toward its outcome. <br>
            My tools, my ‚Äúreaction mechanisms‚Äù, are science, communication, and strategy. <br>
            Sometimes that means translating complex data into clear narratives. <br>
            Sometimes it means designing workflows, structuring ideas, or facilitating alignment inside a team. <br>
            And sometimes it means entering the field with a camera, a lab notebook, or a whiteboard to connect stories with evidence, and evidence with people. <br>
            The result is simple: <br>
            projects move faster, <br>
            teams collaborate better, <br>
            I√πideas become visible, measurable, and real.
