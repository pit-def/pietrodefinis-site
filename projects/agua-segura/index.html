        <h2>Field story</h2>
        <h3>From zero to a shared vision</h3>
        <p>When I arrived in the highlands of San Marcos with a six-month assignment, the partner organisation had never run an environmental monitoring project. Listening to leaders and families made the priority obvious: water safety. Instead of collecting samples myself, I proposed a citizen-science project that communities could own ‚Äî Agua Segura.</p>
        <h3>Designing the framework</h3>
        <p>The plan unfolded in three layers: empower leaders through training, activate a pilot municipality, and create a digital backbone to hold the system together. Workshops happened under tin roofs and beside rivers, where we translated chemistry into everyday practice and overcame language gaps with shared action.</p>
        <h3>Building the digital backbone</h3>
        <p>Paper tables sent over WhatsApp could not sustain the pace, so I rebuilt the workflow with Kobo Toolbox, Make automations and structured dashboards. In weeks we moved from fragmented spreadsheets to a real-time system that anyone with a phone could access, anchored by the <em>Ojo al Agua</em> public site.</p>
        <h3>Creating knowledge that stays</h3>
        <p>Technology without capacity fades. I wrote an eight-chapter online course in Spanish that explained each indicator and action. It became the onboarding tool for new community monitors and ensured the knowledge stayed once my assignment ended.</p>
        <h3>Outcomes and reflections</h3>
        <p>By the handover, three municipalities were active, fifteen community scientists were monitoring water, and the partners had a roadmap toward eleven municipalities. More than dashboards, the project shifted how science was perceived ‚Äî from distant expertise to shared responsibility. Agua Segura taught me that impact means building systems that survive you, blending scientific rigor with empathy and storytelling.</p>
