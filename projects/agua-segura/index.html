        <h2>Project snapshot</h2>
        <p>Agua Segura was born inside Pastoral de la Tierra, a Guatemalan NGO that had never before run environmental monitoring. Over six months I worked with community leaders across three municipalities to co-design a participatory water-quality program. The goal was simple and ambitious: give rural families the knowledge, tools and confidence to test and defend their water sources without depending on external experts.</p>

        <h2>Role and responsibilities</h2>
        <ul class="project-bullets">
          <li>Led project design and coordination as a Servizio Civile Universale volunteer embedded with Pastoral de la Tierra.</li>
          <li>Trained five community leaders and municipal technicians in basic chemistry, sampling protocols and data interpretation.</li>
          <li>Digitalised paper-based logs with Kobo Toolbox forms, Make automations and Google Sheets dashboards.</li>
          <li>Produced the <em>Calidad del Agua</em> open course and communication assets to keep the program alive after the mission.</li>

        <h2>Objectives</h2>
        <ul class="project-bullets">
          <li>Create a locally owned, low-maintenance monitoring system that could expand from one to eleven municipalities.</li>
          <li>Train community leaders to run field tests, understand indicators and advocate for water safety.</li>
          <li>Publish transparent, easy-to-read dashboards so data could influence municipal decisions.</li>
          <li>Use storytelling to connect environmental science with civic participation.</li>

      <div class="container narrow project-section__content">
        <h2>Approach</h2>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Context analysis.</strong> Interviewed local leaders, mapped existing governance and identified barriers to safe drinking water.</li>
          <li><strong>Co-design.</strong> Built protocols together with municipal partners, aligning scientific rigor with cultural practices.</li>
          <li><strong>Pilot and scale.</strong> Tested the workflow with one municipality before expanding to a network of three.</li>
          <li><strong>Digital backbone.</strong> Replaced WhatsApp spreadsheets with Kobo forms feeding an automated database and dashboard.</li>
          <li><strong>Capacity building.</strong> Authored an eight-module Spanish course and facilitated experiential workshops.</li>
          <li><strong>Communication.</strong> Launched the <em>Ojo al Agua</em> site and multimedia stories to keep citizens and authorities engaged.</li>

        <h2>Results</h2>
        <ul class="project-bullets">
          <li>First citizen-science water monitoring network in San Marcos operating beyond the initial assignment.</li>
          <li>Fifteen+ trained community scientists collecting and reporting field data across three municipalities.</li>
          <li>Centralised database and dashboards publicly accessible for advocacy and municipal planning.</li>
          <li>Photo, video and narrative assets documenting the journey and strengthening partner visibility.</li>

        <h2>Impact and learnings</h2>
        <p>The project showed how simple tools, when wrapped in trust and training, can transform communities into guardians of their own resources. The system continues to run after my departure, with partners expanding the network toward eleven municipalities.</p>
        <p>Personally, Agua Segura reinforced the Project Catalyst principle I live by: enter a system, understand its rhythm and leave it stronger than you found it. Designing for continuity matters more than delivering a one-off intervention.</p>
