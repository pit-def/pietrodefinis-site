        <h2>Field story</h2>
        <h4>From zero to a shared vision</h4>
        <p>When I arrived in the highlands of San Marcos, Guatemala, I carried little more than my personal stuff, a few ideas, and six months to make them work. Officially, I was there as a Civil Service volunteer with <strong>Caritas Italiana</strong>, supporting the local partner <strong>Pastoral de la Tierra</strong>. In practice, I was trying to answer a question that has followed me for years: <em>how can science serve people directly, without losing its precision?</em></p>
        <p>The first weeks I was mostly listening. The partner organisation was strong in social action but had never run an environmental monitoring project. They dreamed of one but lacked a clear path. Together we decided to focus on what mattered most to the communities: water. Many families still rely on rivers and wells that are rarely, if ever, tested. Although Guatemalan law requires municipalities to monitor water quality, few actually do.</p>
        <p>The idea took shape as a <strong>citizen-science project</strong> that could outlive my presence. Instead of only collecting samples myself, I would build a system the communities could own. It needed to be simple, transparent, and teachable. We called it <em>Agua Segura</em>.</p>
        <p>The plan unfolded in three layers: 
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Training and empowerment</strong> – form community leaders who could run the tests.</li>
          <li><strong>Data collection</strong> – start with one municipality, then expand to others.</li>
          <li><strong>Digitalization</strong> – replace the fragile paper process with an automated one.</li>
        </ol></p>
        <p>Armed with a portable <strong>combo measurer field system</strong>, I spent the first month introducing the basics: what pH means, why conductivity matters, and how contamination travels through soil and crops. We met under tin roofs, beside rivers, sometimes with kids playing around while we discussed acids and bases. The language barrier was real, my Spanish at time was somewhere around a B1 but non verbal communication skill bridged the gap.</p>
        <p>By the second month, it was clear the paper system would collapse under its own weight. Community members sent handwritten tables via WhatsApp; one staff member typed them into a messy Excel sheet. The process was slow, error-prone, and unsustainable.</p>
        <p>So I designed a <strong>digital workflow</strong> from the tools I had. Using <strong>Kobo Toolbox</strong>, I created mobile forms that automatically uploaded data to the cloud. From there, <strong>an online automations</strong> cleaned and synced the information into Google Sheets and a simple online dashboard. It took me a while to figure it out but in few weeks, we had a real-time system accessible to anyone with a phone.</p>
        <p>To make the data public, I built <strong>Ojo al Agua</strong>, a minimal website on Google Sites. It displayed maps, results, and resources in Spanish, a transparent mirror for both citizens and local authorities.</p>
        <p>Technology alone was not enough. Knowledge had to be passed on. I wrote an <strong>eight-chapter online course</strong> in Spanish, explaining everything from the chemistry of water to interpreting field results and reporting hazards. The text was reviewed by local staff and later published openly on the website. It became the foundation for new leaders joining the program.</p>
        <p>By the end of the project, more than <strong>15 citizens</strong> across <strong>three municipalities</strong> were actively monitoring their water. The goal for the following year: eleven municipalities. I left behind not a closed project, but an expanding network.</p>
        <p>The project delivered tangible results but more subtly, <em>Agua Segura</em> shifted the local perception of science. It showed that science and rural community action can coexist, that evidence, when shared, is power.</p>
        <p>I left Guatemala with more than field data and experience. I learned that designing impact means <strong>building systems that survive you</strong>. Simplicity is not a weakness; it’s one way innovation travels in places with limited resources.</p>
        <p>The project taught me how to merge the precision of science with the empathy of storytelling, a combination that has become central to my identity as a <strong>Project Catalyst</strong>.</p>
        <h3>The Catalyst spirit</h3>
        <p><em>Agua Segura</em> began as a fallback after a failed start in another country. It ended as a prototype for how I want to work in the world: blending chemistry, data, and human collaboration to create visible, lasting impact. The communities of San Marcos continue to collect samples, upload data, and advocate for cleaner rivers. Their results an stories still reach me in another country. Each datapoint or photos is a reminder that transformation starts with attention.</p>
        <p>In the end, I didn’t just monitor water quality, <strong>I helped monitor hope.</strong></p>
