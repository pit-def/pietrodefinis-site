### **3. Objectives and Motivation**

**Problem:**

Rural communities in San Marcos often rely on untreated river or well water. Although Guatemalan law mandates water quality monitoring, municipalities rarely conduct consistent checks.

**Main Objective:**

Develop a participatory system for water-quality monitoring managed directly by local communities, using simple scientific tools and a digital workflow.

**Secondary Objectives:**

- Train local leaders to perform basic water analyses and interpret results.
- Build transparency through public dashboards and open data access.
- Promote environmental awareness and community self-reliance.

**Personal motivation:**

To turn a volunteering assignment into a real-world *Project Catalyst* experiment ‚Äî combining chemistry, digital tools, and human impact to make knowledge actionable.

### **4. Approach and Methodology**

**Method:** *Citizen Science + Agile Implementation*

1. **Context Analysis** ‚Äì mapped community needs and existing water governance.
2. **Co-Design** ‚Äì defined the monitoring protocol collaboratively.
3. **Prototype & Testing** ‚Äì piloted with one municipality, then scaled to three.
4. **Digitalization** ‚Äì transitioned from paper-based logs to Kobo + Make automations.
5. **Capacity Building** ‚Äì wrote and published an 8-module online course on water quality in Spanish.
6. **Communication** ‚Äì launched *Ojo al Agua* public site and community storytelling materials.

**Main challenges:**

- Cultural and linguistic barriers (overcome through experiential workshops).
- Limited digital infrastructure and connectivity.
- Need for a scalable yet low-maintenance system.

---

### **5. Results and Outputs**

**Key Results:**

- Launched the first *citizen-science water monitoring network* in San Marcos.
- 3 municipalities actively collecting and reporting data (target: 11 by 2026).
- 15+ citizens trained in water-quality testing and reporting.
- Centralized database accessible online for transparency and advocacy.

**Deliverables:**

üßæ *‚ÄúCalidad del Agua ‚Äì Curso B√°sico‚Äù* ‚Äì 8-module Spanish training manual.

üåê *Ojo al Agua* public website (Google Sites).

üìä Automated data dashboards linked to live field inputs.

üé• Photo and video materials documenting workshops and fieldwork.

**Impact:**

The project turned data collection into community empowerment ‚Äî linking field chemistry, open data, and civic participation into a replicable model for environmental governance.

---

### **6. Learnings and Reflections**

- **Personal:** I learned how to build systems that keep working even when I‚Äôm gone.
- **Professional:** Strengthened my skills in *project design*, *citizen science*, and *digital transformation for NGOs*.
- **Catalyst spirit:** Entering a system and leaving it stronger ‚Äî equipped with tools, data, and local ownership.

## Agua Segura ‚Äì Scientific Water Monitoring, Guatemala (PAGE)

When I arrived in the highlands of San Marcos, Guatemala, I carried little more than my personal stuff, a few ideas, and six months to make them work. Officially, I was there as a Civil Service volunteer with **Caritas Italiana**, supporting the local partner **Pastoral de la Tierra**. In practice, I was trying to answer a question that has followed me for years: *how can science serve people directly, without losing its precision?*

### From zero to a shared vision

The first weeks were mostly listening. The partner organisation was strong in social action but had never run an environmental monitoring project. They dreamed of one but lacked a clear path. Together we decided to focus on what mattered most to the communities: water. Many families still rely on rivers and wells that are rarely, if ever, tested. Although Guatemalan law requires municipalities to monitor water quality, few actually do.

The idea took shape as a **citizen-science project** that could outlive my presence. Instead of collecting samples myself, I would build a system the communities could own. It needed to be simple, transparent, and teachable. I called it *Agua Segura*.

### Designing the framework

The plan unfolded in three layers.

1. **Training and empowerment** ‚Äì form community leaders who could run the tests.
2. **Data collection** ‚Äì start with one municipality, then expand to others.
3. **Digitalization** ‚Äì replace the fragile paper process with an automated one.

Armed with a portable **Combo measurer field system**, I spent the first month introducing the basics: what pH means, why conductivity matters, and how contamination travels through soil and crops. We met under tin roofs, beside rivers, sometimes with kids playing around while we discussed acids and bases. The language barrier was real, my Spanish at time was somewhere around a B1 but non verbal communication skill bridged the gap. 

### Building the digital backbone

By the second month, it was clear the paper system would collapse under its own weight. Community members sent handwritten tables via WhatsApp; one staff member typed them into a messy Excel sheet. The process was slow, error-prone, and unsustainable.

So I designed a **digital workflow** from the tools I had. Using **Kobo Toolbox**, I created mobile forms that automatically uploaded data to the cloud. From there, **an online automations** cleaned and synced the information into Google Sheets and a simple online dashboard. It took me a while to figure it out but in few weeks, we had a real-time system accessible to anyone with a phone.

To make the data public, I built **Ojo al Agua**, a minimal website on Google Sites. It displayed maps, results, and resources in Spanish, a transparent mirror for both citizens and local authorities.

### Creating knowledge that stays

Technology alone was not enough. Knowledge had to be passed on. I wrote an **eight-chapter online course** in Spanish, explaining everything from the chemistry of water to interpreting field results and reporting hazards. The text was reviewed by local staff and later published openly on the website. It became the foundation for new leaders joining the program.

By the end of the project, more than **15 citizens** across **three municipalities** were actively monitoring their water. The goal for the following year: eleven municipalities. I left behind not a closed project, but an expanding network.

### Outcomes and impact

The project delivered tangible results:

- A **participatory monitoring network** that continues to operate autonomously.
- An **open-source data system** and public website (*Ojo al Agua*).
- A **training curriculum** adopted by the partner organisation for future programs.
- Renewed collaboration between municipalities and citizens on environmental issues.

More subtly, *Agua Segura* shifted the local perception of science. It showed that science and rural community action can coexist, that evidence, when shared, is power.

### Lessons learned

I left Guatemala with more than field data. I learned that designing impact means **building systems that survive you**. Simplicity is not a weakness; it‚Äôs the only way innovation travels in places with limited resources.

The project taught me how to merge the precision of science with the empathy of storytelling, a combination that has become central to my identity as a **Project Catalyst**. Entering a system, understanding its rhythms, and leaving it stronger: that, to me, is success.

### The Catalyst spirit

*Agua Segura* began as a fallback after a failed start in another country. It ended as a prototype for how I want to work in the world: blending chemistry, data, and human collaboration to create visible, lasting impact. The communities of San Marcos continue to collect samples, upload data, and advocate for cleaner rivers. Their results appear on dashboards we built together, each datapoint a reminder that transformation starts with attention.

In the end, I didn‚Äôt just monitor water quality, I helped monitor hope.
