**Period:** April 2025 (2-day workshop, 6 hours total)

**Location:** San Marcos, Guatemala

**Type:** Training · Communication · Facilitation

**Partners:** Pastoral de la Tierra de San Marcos · Caritas Italiana (Servizio Civile Universale)

### Role and Contribution

**Role:** Workshop Designer & Facilitator

**Responsibilities:**

- Designed and delivered a complete communication and digital presentation course for NGO staff.
- Led a two-day, 6-hour workshop for 14 participants (members of Pastoral de la Tierra).
- Introduced theoretical and practical modules on key message framing, public speaking, storytelling, and visual design.

- Created all course materials: theory notes (in Spanish), slide decks, workbooks, and infographics on good presentation design.

**Tools used:** Mentimeter · Canva · PowerPoint · Paper & marker group exercises.

**Approach:** Facilitation-based learning, mixing theory, practice, and creative group play.

### Motivation

The workshop was born from a simple question my local colleagues asked me: *Can you help us communicate better?*

Pastoral de la Tierra, deeply experienced in social work, wanted to improve how they presented their projects to communities and donors. I took this as a chance to merge my background in communication, storytelling, and teaching, and to create something empowering, not academic.

### Approach and Methodology

The training combined three dimensions:

1. Core communication principles – why communication starts with purpose (Start With Why, Simon Sinek); how to define a key message; how to structure impactful presentations.
2. Practical exercises – participants created presentations around absurd scenarios (“Defend humanity from penguins conquering the world”), learning to simplify, prioritize, and engage.
3. Digital & design tools – hands-on sessions using Canva and PowerPoint to create clear, single-concept slides and visual narratives.

The method alternated interactive teaching with group facilitation, encouraging collaboration across ages and backgrounds.

### Results and Outputs

**Key results:**

- 14 participants trained in communication and visual storytelling.
- Improved confidence and clarity in internal and external presentations.
- Delivery of full workshop materials (course outline, slides, exercises, and workbook).
- Creation of visual guides on effective slide design and common mistakes to avoid.

**Impact:**

The workshop marked a shift in how the local NGO approached communication, from merely informing to engaging. It also strengthened team dynamics and creative confidence within Pastoral de la Tierra.

### Learnings

This experience taught me the value of preparation and empathy in facilitation. Teaching communication to communicators of a different culture required active listening, adaptability, and a sense of play.

Standing in front of the team that led the organization, as an outsider invited to teach, was humbling and empowering. It reminded me that recognition comes from usefulness: being able to serve others through clarity.

## What happened?

The communication workshop began almost by surprise. One morning, the director of Pastoral de la Tierra asked if I could run a short training on how to make better presentations. They were used to long PowerPoints filled with text, and wanted something that could engage both communities and funders.

I said yes, perhaps too quickly, and then spent the following weeks designing what would become Comunicacion y Presentaciones Digitales, a two-day workshop blending theory, practice, and humor.

The preparation was intense: I wrote the course entirely in Spanish, structured it around key communication principles, what it means to communicate, how to define a message, why simplicity matters, and built interactive slides and games. I wanted it to be fun, participatory, and memorable.

When the day came, fourteen people gathered in the meeting hall: coordinators, field operators, and the director herself. We started with a Mentimeter question: *What does communication mean to you?* The word cloud grew with terms like dialogue, clarity, trust. That became our base.

We explored concepts like Start With Why, message hierarchy, and the power of repetition. Then, instead of more theory, I divided them into groups and handed out absurd challenges like:

- Convince aliens to spend their holidays on Earth.
- Present a global defense plan against penguins attacking from Antarctica.

The room exploded with laughter and ideas. They had to structure arguments, design slides, and present to everyone else. It was messy, chaotic, alive, and exactly what communication training should be.

The second part focused on design: how to use Canva and PowerPoint to build slides with one idea per screen, use visuals effectively, and avoid the common trap of text overload. We played “spot the bad slide” and created new ones together.

At the end, we gathered in a circle and reflected. Most participants said they had never realized communication could be playful, that it was more about connecting than showing information.

For me, the real impact was not in the slides they created, but in the recognition I received that day. Being asked to lead a course for the very people who managed the project I was part of felt extraordinary. It was a moment of mutual trust, a reminder that influence does not come from hierarchy, but from contribution.

Before leaving, I printed and left behind visual guides and workbooks, summarizing everything we had covered. Weeks later, I saw those posters hanging in the office, annotated with new ideas and examples.

That is when I realized the workshop had done what communication should always do: spark continuity.

It was not just a course, it was a moment of connection, a shared act of learning.

And it reminded me why I do what I do: to make ideas travel further, and to make knowledge feel human.
