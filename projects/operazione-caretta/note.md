# Operazione Caretta – Infiltrato al Nido

### Project Identity

**Title:** Operazione Caretta – Infiltrato al Nido

**Tagline:** When communication becomes protection.

**Period:** Summer 2025

**Location:** Campomarino Lido, Italy

**Type:** Environmental Communication · Volunteering · Storytelling

**Partners:** GADIT Termoli · Centro Studi Cetacei · Local volunteers and environmental guards

### Role and Contribution

**Role:** Volunteer Communicator & Digital Storyteller

**Responsibilities:**

- Joined local volunteers in sea turtle nest monitoring and night patrols.
- Designed and launched a real-time web page in 24 hours to document the nesting and hatching process.
- Created visual and written content (photos, videos, and field stories) to raise awareness among residents and visitors.
- Supported the associations with digital communication strategies and continued collaboration on their institutional websites.

**Tools used:** Camera · Drone · Canva · Notion · HTML website builder.

**Approach:** Observation-driven storytelling and spontaneous volunteering transformed into a communication project.

### Motivation

This was never planned as a project. I simply followed curiosity. Hearing about a turtle nest nearby, I went to see what was happening and ended up staying. What began as a few conversations turned into participation, first in shifts and then in communication. I wanted to give visibility to an invisible story unfolding on that beach.

### Approach and Methodology

- **Field immersion:** Participated in daily and nightly monitoring alongside volunteers.
- **Story-based communication:** Documented through photography, video, and first-person storytelling.
- **Rapid prototyping:** Built a dedicated mini-website within a day to share live updates and reflections.
- **Community engagement:** Encouraged curiosity and participation from passers-by, transforming onlookers into allies.

### Results and Outputs

**Key results:**

- A functional real-time website narrating the nest’s story from incubation to hatching.
- A digital communication system still used as a reference for local outreach.
- Strengthened collaboration between volunteer groups and NGOs.
- Ongoing cooperation with one of the associations to redesign their official website.

**Impact:**

The project helped shift communication from simple documentation to active conservation. Each post, image, and conversation became part of the protection process, generating awareness and empathy.

### Learnings

- Communication can be a form of protection when it connects people emotionally to the environment.
- Collaboration doesn’t always need structure; shared purpose creates natural leadership.
- Even small actions can have deep value: sometimes, one turtle reaching the sea justifies weeks of effort.

## Narrative – Long Form

I never planned to join a turtle protection project. I was simply at home by the sea when someone mentioned that a loggerhead turtle had nested nearby. Out of curiosity, I went to see, and within a few hours I found myself part of the team.

The beach was marked by a small rope square, guarded day and night by local volunteers. What struck me was the calm dedication of everyone involved. No big organization, no grand funding, just people taking turns to protect a patch of sand. I joined their night shifts, shared coffee under the stars, and started taking photos to capture the silence and the small rituals that defined those moments.

Soon, I realized that what the group needed most was visibility. People walking by saw a rope and a sign but didn’t understand what was happening. So, one night, I challenged myself: could I build a simple website overnight to tell this story in real time? Four hours later, the first version was online, with photos, updates, and the story of the nest written clearly for anyone to understand.

The next morning, I showed it to the volunteers. Without formal approval, they kept it online. From that moment, communication became part of the mission. Each update, each post, each question from a visitor turned into education and awareness.

The experience taught me that **communication is not just about telling; it is about connecting**. Showing the hands in the sand, the tired eyes, the patience of waiting — these images transformed passers-by into allies. Awareness grew naturally because people felt included.

Over time, the project evolved into collaboration with the two associations involved. With one of them, I am now rebuilding their institutional website to make their work more visible and accessible.

The nights at the nest left me with a deep sense of community. Leadership there was shared, silent, and organic: those who knew more explained, those with time covered the gaps, those with skills contributed freely. It was a living example of purpose-driven collaboration.

When the first turtle finally reached the sea, I realized how much that single life carried — all our waiting, our care, and our shared hope. It reminded me that not everything needs to be big to be meaningful.

Sometimes, exploration and storytelling merge into something unexpected. Sometimes, communication becomes protection.
