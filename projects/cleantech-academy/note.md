# PABAS Energy – Cleantech Academy

### Project Identity

**Title:** PABAS Energy – Textile and Biomass Co-valorization

**Tagline:** Turning waste into energy, carbon credits, and learning.

**Period:** April – August 2025

**Location:** Online (European-based program)

**Type:** Innovation Challenge · Educational Program · Sustainability

**Partners:** Cleantech Academy · EIT Deep Tech Talent Initiative · PABAS Team

### Role and Contribution

**Role:** Project Designer & Team Contributor

**Responsibilities:**

- Co-developed the project **PABAS Energy**, focused on converting textile and biomass waste through pyrolysis and gasification.
- Researched process feasibility and sustainability metrics (energy yield, biochar quality, potential for carbon credits).
- Contributed to pitch design, communication strategy, and system modeling.
- Participated in interdisciplinary sessions on cleantech innovation and business modeling.

**Tools used:** Notion · Miro · Canva · PowerPoint · Online collaboration platforms.

**Approach:** Applied lean thinking, rapid validation, and environmental impact analysis within a remote, cross-disciplinary setting.

### Motivation

I joined the **Cleantech Academy** looking for a structured innovation experience in sustainability. What I found was something closer to a startup sprint disguised as an educational program: fast-paced teamwork, problem-solving under pressure, and real-world industry challenges.

The motivation was simple: to test my ability to design and communicate a viable cleantech solution within tight time and energy constraints.

### Approach and Methodology

- **Context exploration:** analysis of textile waste and biomass valorization pathways.
- **Collaborative ideation:** developed the concept of a modular, replicable plant producing syngas, biochar, and carbon credits.
- **Feasibility framing:** combined environmental, technical, and economic perspectives to assess potential.
- **Pitch and communication:** structured the final presentation with data clarity and storytelling balance.

### Results and Outputs

**Key results:**

- Selected among the **five winning projects** of the Cleantech Academy 2025.
- Delivered a full project proposal and business case in less than eight weeks.
- Established a foundation for further experimentation and validation of the PABAS Energy concept.

**Impact:**

The project combined environmental awareness with practical systems thinking, demonstrating the potential for small-scale circular energy models in textile waste management.

It also showed how educational challenges can become prototypes for real-world innovation.

### Learnings

- Validation is not a checkbox — it’s a mindset: small, honest tests matter more than perfect slides.
- Energy management is strategic: too many projects dilute focus and reduce creativity.
- Remote collaboration requires structure, clarity, and shared identity to work.
- The best innovations often start as working hypotheses, not finished ideas.

## Narrative – Long Form

When I enrolled in the **Cleantech Academy**, I didn’t have a plan. It was a curiosity-driven decision — a way to re-enter the world of innovation after months spent on a field project in Guatemala. On paper, it looked like a simple training program on clean technologies. In reality, it turned out to be a laboratory for speed, chaos, and collaboration.

The Academy wasn’t just about listening. It was about building. After a few introductory sessions, participants were divided into teams to design a cleantech solution linked to one of five industry challenges. My team, scattered across Europe, worked entirely online. We called our project **PABAS Energy** — a modular system that transforms textile waste and biomass residues into energy and biochar through pyrolysis and gasification.

At first, it sounded ambitious. In practice, it was an intense crash course in problem-solving under pressure. We had to balance chemistry, business logic, and environmental responsibility while managing different time zones and communication styles. I took on the role of connector — organizing discussions, clarifying deliverables, and translating complexity into clear presentations.

Our concept worked because it was honest. We didn’t oversell it as a startup; we presented it as a *working hypothesis*. The idea was technically plausible, environmentally sound, and potentially scalable. It made sense — and that was enough to win. We were selected among the **five winning teams**, earning visibility and the opportunity to further develop the concept beyond the program.

Yet, the real value of the experience came from what happened behind the slides. The long nights aligning the pitch, the micro-moments of clarity when a complex idea finally clicked, the humility of saying “we don’t know yet, but we can test it.”

In the weeks that followed, I realized how much the program mirrored real innovation cycles: messy, nonlinear, human. It forced me to apply everything I had learned from previous projects — facilitation, design thinking, and communication — in a new context. It also reminded me that innovation without validation is just speculation. What matters is moving from hypothesis to experiment, from concept to contact with reality.

**PABAS Energy** remains a work in progress. Together with some teammates, we’re continuing to explore the technical side, from feedstock characterization to process optimization. It’s not a company yet — but it’s something even more valuable: a live experiment, a seed that keeps teaching.

Looking back, the Cleantech Academy didn’t just train me in sustainability. It tested my adaptability, my focus, and my ability to make sense out of uncertainty. It turned a simple idea into a microcosm of what I want my work to be: collaborative, concrete, and driven by curiosity.
