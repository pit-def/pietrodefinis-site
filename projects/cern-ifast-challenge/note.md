# X-Ray MAGIC – Challenge-Based Innovation at CERN

### Project Identity

**Title:** X-Ray MAGIC – Particle Accelerators for Human Health

**Tagline:** When childhood curiosity meets scientific innovation.

**Period:** 22–31 July 2025

**Location:** European Scientific Institute (Archamps, France) · CERN (Geneva, Switzerland)

**Type:** Research · Innovation · Interdisciplinary Collaboration

**Partners:** I.FAST · European Scientific Institute · CERN · HITRIplus

**Team:** The T.E.A.M. (Terrific Experts in Accelerating Medicine)

### Role and Contribution

**Role:** Project Catalyst & Team Facilitator

**Responsibilities:**

- Co-developed an innovative concept using particle accelerator technology for medical applications.
- Led facilitation and coordination across a multidisciplinary team of physicists, engineers, and biomedical researchers.
- Applied Agile and Design Thinking methods (timeboxing, retrospectives, value mapping).
- Supported technical and conceptual synthesis of the final prototype presentation.
- Represented the team during the final pitch at CERN’s Council Chamber.

**Tools used:** Miro · Canva · Google Workspace · Agile frameworks · Communication mapping.

**Approach:** Integrating systems thinking, scientific creativity, and human-centered facilitation.

### Motivation

The project started from a simple yet bold question: *How can particle accelerators improve human health?*

For me, this challenge represented the convergence of two worlds — the dream of the boy who built homemade particle experiments and the professional curiosity of the adult who now builds real systems. Joining the Challenge-Based Innovation program was not just about competing, but reconnecting with the spirit of exploration that first made me fall in love with science.

### Approach and Methodology

- **Team synergy:** Balanced collaboration between diverse disciplines (physics, biomedicine, chemistry, and engineering).
- **Catalyst mindset:** Facilitated decision-making through the recurring question “So what?” — transforming data into value.
- **Design-driven innovation:** Combined technical feasibility with patient-centered design.
- **Agile sprint structure:** 10 days of intense co-creation, from research framing to final pitch.

### Results and Outputs

**Key results:**

- Developed **X-Ray MAGIC**, an injectable bone cement activated on-demand by low-dose diagnostic X-rays.
- Concept awarded as *“most feasible and high-impact”* among final projects.
- Established strong interdisciplinary collaboration and long-term professional connections.
- Personal milestone achieved: entering CERN not as a visitor, but as an innovator.

**Impact:**

Demonstrated how human collaboration can accelerate innovation beyond technology. The experience validated the idea that innovation is a social process built on trust, curiosity, and clarity of purpose.

### Learnings

- Innovation is human before it is technological: alignment of perspectives is the foundation of impact.
- The right question accelerates progress more than any tool or technique.
- Childhood curiosity is not naive; it is a lifelong fuel for discovery.
- Leadership can mean facilitating others’ brilliance rather than leading from the front.

## Narrative – Long Form

From the moment I received the acceptance email, I knew this wasn’t going to be just another scientific workshop. *Challenge-Based Innovation 2025* was an experiment in itself: ten days to rethink how particle accelerators could improve human health. The setting — the **European Scientific Institute** in Archamps, with the final presentation at **CERN** — was already a dream come true.

I joined **The T.E.A.M.**, short for *Terrific Experts in Accelerating Medicine*. It began as a joke, but soon became an identity. We were an improbable mix of physicists, chemists, and biomedical researchers. By day three, the storming phase had hit: misunderstandings, technical gaps, and pressure. Yet somehow, that chaos became cohesion. My role wasn’t to manage, but to catalyze — to keep asking the question that guided our entire process: *So what?* What difference would this make for patients, surgeons, or the real world?

That question pushed us beyond theory. We explored materials, radiation mechanisms, and medical contexts until we found an elegant intersection: an injectable **bone cement** that could harden on demand under controlled X-ray exposure. The concept — **X-Ray MAGIC** — combined bioactive materials with radioluminescent particles and a photoinitiator that triggers polymerization under X-rays. It was science fiction turned into plausible innovation.

The intensity of the sprint was unmatched: 12–14 hours a day, brainstorming, testing ideas, building mock-ups. The human side was what made it work. We trusted each other enough to disagree openly and move fast. Our “day off” in Annecy wasn’t rest; it was where we built the emotional glue that carried us through the final stretch.

The last day at CERN was surreal. Walking through the tunnels, surrounded by coils, detectors, and decades of discovery, I realized how every past experiment in my own life — the homemade cloud chambers, the garage prototypes — had led here. This wasn’t a tourist visit; it was a return to a childhood dream, now reframed through purpose.

Our pitch took place in the **Council Chamber**, the same hall where Nobel laureates have debated and decided the future of physics. I could feel the weight of that space, but also the energy of a team that had built something authentic. We didn’t win, but we were recognized for presenting the *most feasible and impactful project*. That sentence was enough — realistic in our vision, grounded in what mattered.

I left CERN with no trophy, but with something more enduring: perspective. I had seen how the smallest idea, when combined with the right people, can expand into something greater. I had seen that innovation is not a lightning strike but a human chain reaction.

And perhaps most importantly, I had rediscovered the thread connecting the boy who built experiments in the dark to the man who now builds opportunities for others to do the same.

Curiosity, after all, is the most powerful accelerator we have.
