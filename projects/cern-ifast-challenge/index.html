        <h2>Field story</h2>
        <h3>Entering the experiment</h3>
        <p>Challenge-Based Innovation 2025 compressed ten days into a single question: how can particle accelerators improve human health? Joining The T.E.A.M. — Terrific Experts in Accelerating Medicine — meant embracing chaos, misunderstandings and the pressure of building something worthy of CERN.</p>
        <h3>Finding the concept</h3>
        <p>By asking “So what?” we pushed beyond theory and landed on an elegant intersection: an injectable bone cement activated under controlled X-ray exposure. X-Ray MAGIC blended bioactive materials with radioluminescent particles, making science fiction feel plausible.</p>
        <h3>Human chain reaction</h3>
        <p>The sprint rhythm was relentless, but trust turned intensity into flow. A supposed rest day in Annecy became the bonding moment that aligned us for the final stretch.</p>
        <h3>CERN’s Council Chamber</h3>
        <p>Presenting in the Council Chamber, where Nobel laureates debated physics, reframed my own journey. We didn’t win the competition, yet mentors called our concept the most feasible and high-impact. That recognition confirmed that innovation thrives on clarity, not theatrics.</p>
        <h3>After the sprint</h3>
        <p>I left CERN without a trophy but with perspective: the boy who built particle experiments in his garage had returned, now as a catalyst creating space for others to innovate. Curiosity remains the most powerful accelerator we have.</p>

        <h2>Process</h2>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Framing.</strong> Reframed the challenge through interviews with mentors from CERN, HITRIplus and med-tech startups, identifying unmet needs in bone regeneration.</li>
          <li><strong>Ideation.</strong> Co-created system maps and value propositions that balanced accelerator capabilities with clinical workflow realities.</li>
          <li><strong>Validation.</strong> Prototyped interaction scripts, tested assumptions with domain experts and iterated on radiation safety scenarios.</li>
          <li><strong>Storycraft.</strong> Crafted a multi-layer pitch that blended feasibility, impact and emotion for the final presentation at CERN.</li>
