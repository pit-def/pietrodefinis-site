        <h2>Project story</h2>
        <p>From the moment I received the acceptance email, I knew this wasn’t going to be just another scientific workshop. <em>Challenge-Based Innovation 2025</em> was an experiment in itself: ten days to rethink how particle accelerators could improve human health. The settings, the <strong>European Scientific Institute</strong> in Archamps, with the final presentation at <strong>CERN</strong>, was already a dream come true.</p>
        <p>With an energetic collaborator and collegues we created <strong>The T.E.A.M.</strong>, short for <em>Terrific Experts in Accelerating Medicine</em>. It began as a joke, but soon became an identity. We were an improbable mix of physicists, chemists, and biomedical researchers. By day three, the storming phase had hit: misunderstandings, technical gaps, and pressure. Yet somehow, that chaos became cohesion. My role wasn’t to manage, but to catalyze. Was to keep asking the question that guided our entire process: <em>So what?</em> What difference would this make for patients, surgeons, or the real world?</p>
        <p>That question pushed us beyond theory. We explored materials, radiation mechanisms, and medical contexts until we found an elegant intersection: an injectable <strong>bone cement</strong> that could harden on demand under controlled X-ray exposure. The concept, named <strong>X-Ray MAGIC</strong>, combined bioactive materials with radioluminescent particles and a photoinitiator that trigger a reaction under X-rays. It was science fiction turned into plausible innovation.</p>
        <p>The intensity of the sprint was unmatched: 12–14 hours a day, followin seminars, brainstorming, testing ideas, building mock-ups. The human side was what made it work. We trusted each other enough to disagree openly and move fast. Our “day off” in Annecy wasn’t rest; it was where we built the emotional glue that carried us through the final stretch.</p>
        <p>The visit day at CERN was surreal. Walking through the tunnels, surrounded by coils, detectors, and decades of discovery, I realized how every past experiment in my own life, form the homemade cloud chambers to the garage prototypes, had led here. This wasn’t a tourist visit; it was a return to a childhood dream, now reframed through purpose.</p>
        <p>Our pitch took place in the <strong>Council Chamber</strong>, the same hall where Nobel laureates have debated and decided the future of physics. I could feel the weight of that space, but also the energy of a team that had built something authentic. We didn’t win the challenge, but we were recognized for presenting the <em>most feasible and impactful project</em>. That sentence was enough: realistic in our vision, grounded in what mattered.</p>
        <p>I left CERN with no trophy, but with something more enduring: perspective. I had seen how the smallest idea, when combined with the right people, can expand into something greater. I had seen that innovation is not a lightning strike but a human chain reaction.</p>
        <p>And perhaps most importantly, I had rediscovered the thread connecting the boy who built experiments in the dark to the man who now builds opportunities for others to do the same.</p>
        <p><strong>Curiosity, after all, is the most powerful accelerator we have.</strong></p>
